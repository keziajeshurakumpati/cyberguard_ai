## 💡 Talking Points for Judges

### Problem Statement
"Cybersecurity is reactive. By the time traditional systems detect an attack, damage is already done. We needed a proactive approach."

### Our Innovation
"We built an AI system that learns attacker behavior and predicts their next move—giving defenders an 8-minute head start."

### Market Opportunity
"The average data breach costs $4.5M. Our system prevents breaches before they happen."

### Competitive Advantage
"Traditional systems use signatures—they can't detect what they don't know. Our AI uses behavioral analysis to catch zero-day exploits."

### Scalability
"Processing 1.2 million events per second with sub-100ms response time. Enterprise-ready from day one."
